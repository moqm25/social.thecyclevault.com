# BUILD LOG — The CycleVault Social

> Living handoff doc. If a session ends (tokens/credits), resume from
> **§ Next action**. Every completed step is checked; every command is recorded so

- **Repo:** `github.com/moqm25/social.thecyclevault.com`
- **Firebase account:** `moiezqamar@gmail.com`
- **Firebase project ID:** `cyclevault-social` (region `us-central1`)
- **Product name:** **The CycleVault** ("The" is part of the name — keep casing).
- **Authoritative specs:** `docs/adr/0001-foundational-architecture.md` + the 9
  Phase 0 docs. This log records _execution_, not design.

## ⚠ One thing waiting on you (1 console click)

Firebase **Authentication is not initialized** on the project, so signups fail with
`CONFIGURATION_NOT_FOUND`. This one-time init can't be done with the CLI token — it
needs the console:

1. Open <https://console.firebase.google.com/project/cyclevault-social/authentication>
2. Click **Get started**.
3. **Sign-in method** → **Email/Password** → toggle **Enable** → **Save**.
   (Leave "Email link / passwordless" OFF.)

That's it — everything else in the backend is already deployed and verified. The
forum UI build does not depend on this (it uses the local emulator).

---

## ▶ Next action

**Building the forum UI (Phase G).** Backend is deployed + verified in prod; the
only backend gap is the founder's one-click Auth init (note at top). Build order:
feed + community pages → post detail + comments + composer → voting (optimistic) →
profile/notifications/settings → mod/admin. All against the local emulator, wired
to the live callables. Public cutover (Part B) stays deferred until the UI is ready.

---

## Live-site safety (important)

The repo **root `index.html` is the live "Coming soon" page** served by GitHub
Pages from `main`. Replacing it is **gated** (Phase F). To avoid breaking it during
development, the SPA is built in a **`web/` subfolder** (slight divergence from the
docs' root layout, chosen for live-site safety). `functions/` stays at repo root.
At go-live, GitHub Pages source switches to **GitHub Actions** which builds
`web/` → `dist/` and publishes it.

---

## Locked decisions (2026-06-26)

- Single **production** project + Local Emulator Suite for dev (staging added later).
- Project ID `cyclevault-social`; Firestore region `us-central1`.
- Auth: **email/password** at launch (Google later, no rework).
- Hosting: **GitHub Pages** (not Firebase Hosting) on `social.thecyclevault.com`.
- Blaze upgrade + first cloud deploy are **gated** on explicit founder approval.

---

## Environment (verified 2026-06-26)

- Node `v22.17.0`, npm `10.9.2`
- firebase-tools `15.7.0` (logged in: `moiezqamar@gmail.com`)
- gh CLI `2.83.1` (logged in: `moqm25`)
- ✅ **Java installed** via `brew install openjdk` (keg-only, OpenJDK 26). It is
  **not on the default PATH** — prefix emulator commands with:
  `export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH"` (CI uses actions/setup-java).

---

## Phase 0 — Config layer ✅ (committed)

- [x] `firestore.rules` — from `docs/SECURITY_RULES.md`
- [x] `firestore.indexes.json` — 14 composite indexes from `docs/DATA_MODEL.md §14`
- [x] `storage.rules` — restrictive; avatars Phase 2
- [x] `firebase.json` — firestore + storage + emulators (no hosting)
- [x] `.firebaserc` — `default → cyclevault-social`
- [x] `.gitignore`, `.env.example`

## Phase A — Cloud project (free, Spark plan) ⏳

- [x] `firebase projects:create cyclevault-social --display-name "The CycleVault Social"`
- [x] `firebase apps:create WEB "The CycleVault Social Web"` → App ID
      `1:841106244670:web:c27119d5f1bd4edc167d6f` (project number `841106244670`)
- [x] `firebase apps:sdkconfig WEB <appId>` → real values written to `web/.env.local`
- [x] Enabled GCP APIs via Service Usage REST (Firebase CLI token): firestore,
      cloudfunctions, firebasestorage, identitytoolkit ✅. cloudbuild +
      artifactregistry returned **needs-billing** → deferred to Phase F (Blaze).
- [x] `firebase firestore:databases:create "(default)" --location=us-central1` ✅
- [ ] (Console, manual) Enable Auth → Email/Password provider (Identity Toolkit API
      already on; provider toggle done at go-live or via REST)

## Phase B — Frontend scaffold ⏳

- [x] Vite + React + TypeScript (strict) app in `web/` (`src/`)
- [x] Tailwind + brand tokens from `thecyclevault.com/site.css`; light/dark theming
- [x] React Router routes (`docs/UI_REQUIREMENTS.md §3`); Home + 404 + placeholders
- [x] TanStack Query + Zod + React Hook Form wired
- [x] `lib/firebase` (SDK init + emulator switch), `lib/env` (zod-validated),
      `lib/api` (typed callables), `types/models`
- [x] App shell (top bar, theme toggle, user menu, disclaimer footer), brand wordmark
- [x] Auth feature: email/password sign-in + sign-up (username reservation),
      `AuthProvider`, `ProtectedRoute` (role-aware), reusable Button/TextField
- [x] Build green: split bundles — app 37KB / react 53KB / firebase 112KB gz
      (~203KB total, < 300KB budget); lint clean; 2 tests pass
- Note: signup's `createUserProfile` call needs the backend (Phase C) live in the
  emulator to fully work end-to-end.

## Phase C — Backend (Cloud Functions, TypeScript) ⏳

- [x] `functions/` package (2nd gen, Node 20, region us-central1, maxInstances 10)
- [x] Zod schemas + shared helpers (admin, auth guards, rate limit, audit, ranking,
      notify, validate)
- [x] Implemented `docs/API_CONTRACT.md`: createUserProfile, reserveUsername;
      createPost/updatePost/deletePostSoft/lockPost; createComment/updateComment/
      deleteCommentSoft; voteOnPost/voteOnComment (transactional); reportContent/
      removeContent/restoreContent/suspendUser/banUser/unbanUser/dismissReport/
      setUserRole; markNotificationRead; exportMyData/deleteMyAccount
- [x] `functions/scripts/seedCommunities.mjs` (idempotent, emulator + prod)
- [x] tsc build clean + eslint clean
- [ ] firebase.json updated with functions config ✅ (predeploy lint+build)

## Phase D — Testing ⏳ (Java installed)

- [x] Security-rules tests (`@firebase/rules-unit-testing`) — **23 tests**, full
      capability matrix incl. role-escalation + field-smuggle + default-deny
- [x] E2E function tests (full emulator: auth+functions+firestore) — **2 tests**:
      signup→profile→post→vote (score 0→1→idempotent→0) + unauth rejection
- [x] Unit tests (Vitest): voteMath (7) + ranking (5) = **12**; web HomePage **2**
- [x] Total: **39 tests passing** across web + functions + rules + e2e
- [ ] Component tests (RTL) beyond smoke; Playwright E2E — later (post-MVP UI)
- Run: `tests/` → `npm test` (rules), `npm run test:e2e` (full stack, seeds first)

## Phase E — CI/CD ✅

- [x] `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — on push/PR: web (lint+typecheck+test+build),
      functions (lint+build+unit), rules+E2E (emulators w/ setup-java). No deploys.
- [x] `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — **manual `workflow_dispatch` only**, target
      web|firebase|both. Gated; documents Blaze + Pages-source + vars/secrets needs.
- [x] Pages SPA `404.html` fallback (rafgraph technique) + restore script in
      index.html; `.nojekyll`; `CNAME` in `web/public/` — verified emitted to dist/.
- Note: did NOT switch Pages to Actions (that's the gated go-live step), so the
  live Coming-soon page is untouched.

## Phase F — GO-LIVE (gated) — backend deployed ✅ / public cutover pending

**Part A — Backend go-live (done 2026-06-27, Blaze enabled by founder):**

- [x] Enabled billing-gated APIs (cloudbuild, artifactregistry, run, eventarc).
- [x] `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes` ✅ (prod).
- [x] `firebase deploy --only functions` — **all 20 callables LIVE** in
      us-central1 (v2/nodejs20). Smoke test: unauth call → 401 `UNAUTHENTICATED`.
- [x] Seeded 6 communities in prod via `scripts/seedCommunitiesProd.mjs` (REST +
      CLI token; idempotent).
- [ ] **Auth init** — founder console click (see note at top). Until then signups
      return `CONFIGURATION_NOT_FOUND`.
- [ ] Storage rules deploy — deferred: needs one-time bucket "Get started". Storage
      is Phase 2 (no uploads at launch), so not blocking.

**Part B — Public cutover (deferred until forum UI exists):**

- [ ] Repo Variables `VITE_FIREBASE_*`; Pages source → GitHub Actions; run gated
      `web` deploy (replaces the live Coming-soon page); publish forum privacy+terms.

## Phase G — Forum UI (in progress)

- [ ] Feed (Hot/New/Top) + community pages, PostCard + VoteControl (optimistic)
- [ ] Post detail + threaded comments + composer
- [ ] Profile, notifications, settings; mod/admin dashboards
- Built against the local emulator; wired to the live callables in `lib/api.ts`.
